## How to Play
The green 'X' indicates the position that your ship will move to in the next turn, based on your momentum. You can fire your rockets to plot your course by moving the green 'X' with the arrow keys or numpad. The '0' indicates your course if you make no adjustments. Press space to end the turn. Beware that the amount you can adjust your ship's course in any one turn is limited by the maneuverability and propulsion of your ship!
